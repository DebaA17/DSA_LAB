A tree in data structures is a hierarchical structure (like a family tree). Unlike arrays or linked lists that are linear, a tree branches out.

Each element in a tree is called a node.

The topmost node is the root.

A node can have children (nodes connected below it).

If a node has no children, it’s called a leaf.

A binary tree (the most common one you’ll learn first in C) means every node has at most two children: left and right.

In C, we usually represent a tree node like this:


struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* left;
    struct Node* right;
};

This lets each node hold some data and pointers to its two children
